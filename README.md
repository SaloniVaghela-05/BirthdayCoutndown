# BirthdayCountdown
In case you forget your loved one's birthday


While Learning Python I thought of using the random number generating feature to implement a Birthday Countdown.
First, I created a simple single-file program that checks the current date and prints the corresponding message from the array of messages, if it's your birthday, or else displays the number of days left.

Then I learnt how to import already existing files into a current file we are working on, and so we have birthday_countdown2.py as I separated the messages in a different file, "birthday_messages.py"


Finally, I created a fully functional website that allows you to even add birthdays to your calendar.
"birthday_countdown3.py"
